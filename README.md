`pipe/s` - an extensive and systematic ensemble of [concurrency](readme/adverts.md)-based mechanisms

- as ready-to-use generic production-grade code
- in different sizes such [`s`](s/) and [`m`](m/) (mind You: one size never fit's all)
- with comprehensively explained concepts, formulas and terminology - [readme](readme/)
- complemented with lots of 'how-to-do' and 'how-to-use' [expamples](expamples/).

- Follow a (hopefully) enlightening [evolution](readme/evolve.md).
- Begin with oversimplified (but popular!) [code](readme/in-the-wild.md).
- Encounter dangerous [pitfalls and easy-to-do mistakes](readme/pitfalls.md) along the way.
- Improve Your use of vaccines and protective habits.
- Ascend to implementations of [some](any/) higher-level concepts such as 'load balancer', 'circular crawler' ...
- Eventually encounter the little-known land of concurrent **lazy** evaluation.

That's where we aim to go here - using [go](https.//golang.org/ "golang.org"), common sense and playful discipline.

Note: `pipe/s` complements Your existing types and functions - intentionally it is **not** a framework.

Are You ready for this?

```
    go get -u github.com/GoLangsam/pipe
```

Still in doubt? Have a peek at the short [prolog](readme/prolog.md).
And the [overview](readme/overview.md) is a good place to start...

May, what You find here in this repo, be a trustworthy and helpful companion along Your journey. Enjoy!

Please feel free and encouraged to suggest, improve, comment or ask - You'll be welcome!
