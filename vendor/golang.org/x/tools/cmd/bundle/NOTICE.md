# Notice

This version of `bundle` has been patched! Quick and dirty!

- prefix is not mandatory any more (No need for prefix here!)
- remove the trailing `//go generate bundle` comment - not helful to have such in target
- prepend a trailing (and hardcoded - argh) notice
- usage says "A quick and dirty patch of bundle!\n"

If You use the original in other projects, take care to not unintentionally overwrite Your original executable.
