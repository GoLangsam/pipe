// Beg of ThingFanIn1 - fan-in using only one go routine

// ThingFanIn1 returns a channel to receive all inputs arriving
// on variadic inps
// before close.
//
//  Note: Only one go routine is used for all receives,
//  which keeps trying open inputs in round-robin fashion
//  until all inputs are closed.
//
// See ThingFanIn in `fan-in` for another implementation.
