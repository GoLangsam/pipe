// Beg of ThingPipeEnter/Leave - Flapdoors observed by a Waiter

// ThingWaiter - as implemented by `*sync.WaitGroup` -
// attends Flapdoors and keeps counting
// who enters and who leaves.
//
// Use DoneThingWait to learn about
// when the facilities are closed.
//
// Note: You may also use Your provided `*sync.WaitGroup.Wait()`
// to know when to close the facilities.
// Just: DoneThingWait is more convenient
// as it also closes the primary channel.
//
// Just make sure to have _all_ entrances and exits attended,
// and `Wait()` only *after* You've started flooding the facilities.
