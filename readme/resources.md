- [Go by Example: Channels](https://gobyexample.com/channels)

  " _Channels_ are the pipes that connect concurrent goroutines.
   You can send values into channels from one goroutine and receive those values into another goroutine."
  
  "Channels are typed by the values they convey."

  Includes interesting stuff such as basic concurrency patterns.

- [Simple Data Processing Pipeline with Golang](https://www.hugopicado.com/2016/09/26/simple-data-processing-pipeline-with-golang.html) by [Hugo Picado](https://www.hugopicado.com/) Sep. 26, 2016
- [Sources](https://github.com/picadoh/gostreamer)

  "In this example we are building a simple processing pipeline that consumes a text line from a socket and sends it through a series of processes to extract independent words, filter the ones starting with # and printing the result to the console. For this, a set of structures and functions were created so we can try around and build other kind of pipelines at will."

  - Has a `Collector.Execute` as `Fan-In (cap=1)` and a `Processor.Execute`, and a `ChannelDemux.Execute` for non-random FanOut.
  - Uses `type ProcessFunction func(name string, input Message, out chan Message)`
  - Code flavour is `ssss`

  `merge` - a Fan-In, not -Out! (with sync.WaitGroup for closer, and 'done' as context)

  - Fan-In sample from above, "(shamelessly stolen from [here](http://blog.golang.org/pipelines))" 
  - Delves into "channel is a functor" and "Futures & Promises", but does not distinguish supply and demand (but uses it)

  Buffered channels are useful when you know how many goroutines you have launched, want to limit the number of goroutines you will launch, or want to limit the amount of work that is queued up.

  - Parallel Processing
  - Creating a Pool

- [Abundant concurrency in Go](https://hunterloftis.github.io/2017/07/14/abundant-concurrency/)

  Contrasts his 'JavaScripterâ€™s mindset' with an 'abundance mindset'.

- [Go Concurrency Patterns](https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/golang-concurrency-patterns/)

  I feel compelled to point out that, due to the fact that Go uses a coöperative scheduler, any goroutine that is CPU bound could starve your whole program.
  If you know for sure that you are writing such a function and that it’s likely to take a while, it would be wise to add a `runtime.Gosched()` (formerly spelled `time.Sleep(0)`) in a few places.
