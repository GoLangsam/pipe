# Prolog

Design and build robust concurrent software in [Go](https.//golang.org/ "golang.org") - an exciting challenge.

Concurrency fosters designs which can be more natural than sequential ones. You doubt? There are [examples](examples/).

[Go](https.//golang.org/ "golang.org") provides primitives which enable concurrency - which enables parallel processing..
And [praises](readme/adverts.md) them as _free_, _cheap_, _easy_ and _simple_.

Most notably: Channels and goroutines - "big ideas" and the standard `sync` package with "tools for smaller problems".

And - as usual for almost anything being advertised as _free_, _cheap_, _easy_ and/or _simple_ - strings are attached.

Caveat! There are [pitfalls](pitfalls.md) out there! Good understanding and proper care helps a lot to avoid them. 

May, what You find here in this repo, be a trustworthy and helpful companion along Your journey. Enjoy!
